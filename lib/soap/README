Installing soap4r:
  - don't use the gem (at least on OS X); it doesn't work
  - download the code from http://dev.ctor.org/download/soap4r-1.5.8.tar.gz
  - see install instructions at http://blog.unifia.fr/?tag=wsdl2ruby-problem
  - check that the code installed in the correct location (it seems to want to add site_ruby to the install path)
  - run wsdl2ruby.rb from the bin directory in the downloaded code directory, not from the installed code directory
